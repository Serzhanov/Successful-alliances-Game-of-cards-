# Successful-alliances-Game-of-cards-
We mix the cards, we get a bunch of cards that will constitute the deck. We take the cards one by one one in the draw pile and we put them side by side from left to right. 
When we have placed three cards, we consider the cards 1 and 3 (numbering them from left to right). If they are the same color or the same value (what we will call an alliance),
we take the card between them (here card number 2) and we put it on card 1 (otherwise we do nothing and we continue to draw). This is what we will call a "jump". 
So we potentially more than two heaps
